# Cosmic Letterbox

Cosmic Letterbox is a digital experience inspired by the vastness and wonder of space, where users can send, receive, and collect virtual letters as if they are messages adrift among the stars. Dive into a dynamic universe of communication, serendipity, and discovery—each letter you find might be a heartfelt note, a playful secret, or a surprise greeting from someone light-years away.

Envisioned as an interactive cosmic post office, the platform lets you create messages and set them free into the galaxy for others to discover, while also opening letters from unknown senders scattered across the digital cosmos. The project emphasizes exploration, connection, and the joy of unexpected encounters, evoking the feeling of stumbling upon stardust-laced stories shared by curious travelers throughout the universe.
